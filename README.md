# Be Holmes | Prediction Market Intelligence Terminal

## Overview

Be Holmes is an AI-native decision support system engineered to bridge the gap between unstructured natural language intelligence and decentralized prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket).

In the domain of event derivatives, information asymmetry often exists between breaking news and on-chain probability pricing. Be Holmes functions as an end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent that ingests raw intelligence, semantically maps it to live prediction contracts, and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to compute an "Alpha Verdict" based on Bayesian inference logic.

## System Architecture & Logic

The core operational logic of Be Holmes follows a strict three-stage pipeline designed to eliminate hallucination and focus on actionable insights.

### 1. Intelligence Injection (Input Layer)
The user inputs unstructured text into the system. This can be breaking news headlines, social sentiment, geopolitical rumors, or specific event queries. The system does not rely on rigid keyword matching; instead, it analyzes the semantic intent of the input.

### 2. Neural Semantic Mapping (Retrieval Layer)
* **Engine:** Exa.ai (Neural Search)
* **Process:** The system converts the input intelligence into high-dimensional vector embeddings. It then queries the web specifically targeting prediction market domains (Polymarket).
* **Goal:** This allows the system to identify correlated betting markets even if the keywords do not match exactly (e.g., mapping "Trump's legal issues" to a specific "Presidential Pardon" contract).

### 3. Bayesian Alpha Decoding (Analysis Layer)
* **Engine:** Google Gemini (Cognitive Core)
* **Data Stream:** Polymarket Gamma API (Real-time Odds & Volume)
* **Process:** The system synthesizes two distinct data sets:
    1.  **The Intel:** The semantic implication of the user's input.
    2.  **The Market:** The current implied probability (Price) and liquidity (Volume) of the relevant contracts.
* **Output:** The LLM acts as a macro-analyst to determine if the news is already "priced-in" or if a divergence exists between the event's real-world probability and its market price.

## Features

* **Semantic Market Discovery:** Locates prediction markets based on meaning rather than keywords using neural search architectures.
* **Real-Time Odds Integration:** Fetches live pricing (Yes/No shares) and volume data directly from the Polymarket Gamma API.
* **Multi-Outcome Support:** Automatically normalizes data for both binary markets and complex multi-choice markets.
* **Institutional-Grade Briefing:** Generates concise, rational, and data-driven analysis reports focusing on "Priced-in Checks" and "Bluff vs. Reality."
* **Live Intelligence Ticker:** Integrated real-time news feed via CryptoPanic Developer API (v2) to track market-moving events instantly.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend/App Framework:** Python (Streamlit)
* **Neural Search:** Exa.ai SDK
* **Inference Engine:** Google Gemini (Generative AI)
* **Market Data:** Polymarket Gamma API (REST)
* **News Data:** CryptoPanic API v2

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* API Keys for Exa.ai, Google Gemini, and CryptoPanic.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/be-holmes.git](https://github.com/your-username/be-holmes.git)
    cd be-holmes
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys**
    Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory and add your credentials. Ensure strict TOML formatting:

    ```toml
    EXA_API_KEY = "your_exa_key_here"
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_gemini_key_here"
    CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY = "your_cryptopanic_key_here"
    ```

4.  **Execute the application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

## Usage Protocol

1.  **Initialize:** Launch the terminal. The bottom ticker will immediately begin streaming real-time rising news.
2.  **Input:** Paste a news snippet or type a query into the main context window (e.g., "Fed signals interest rate cuts in March").
3.  **Execute:** Click "Decode Alpha."
4.  **Review:**
    * **Market Cards:** Observe the identified markets, current odds, and volume.
    * **Verdict:** Read the AI-generated briefing to understand the implied probability versus the intelligence provided.
